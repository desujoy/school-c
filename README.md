# School-C
This is a collection of C programs that I have done in my school. These programs are mostly based on the topics covered in the syllabus of the CBSE board for class 11 and 12. Some of the topics include:

- Arrays
- Pointers
- Structures
- Functions
- Recursion
- File handling
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues

# How to use
To run these programs, you will need a C compiler and an IDE. You can use any compiler and IDE of your choice, but I recommend using [GCC] as the compiler and [Code::Blocks] as the IDE. You can download them from their respective websites.

To compile and run a program, follow these steps:

Open the program file in Code::Blocks.
Click on Build and Run from the menu bar or press F9.
A console window will open and display the output of the program.
